\begin{abstract}
\noindent

This document presents an implementation of an algorithm to perform a morphological opening on a graph. The intent is to remove short branches in a graph while preserving the large scale structure. This implementation is based on the algorithm described in ``Efficient Closed Contour Extraction from Range Image's Edge Points''. We have used the data structures from Boost Graph Library (BGL).

The code is available here:
